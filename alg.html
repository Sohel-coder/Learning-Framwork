Algebra (from Arabic "al-jabr", literally meaning "reunion of broken parts"[1]) is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols;[2] it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.[3] It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra; the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians.

Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.[4] For example, in {\displaystyle x+2=5}x+2=5 the letter {\displaystyle x}x is unknown, but applying additive inverses can reveal its value: {\displaystyle x=3}x=3. In E = mc2, the letters {\displaystyle E}E and {\displaystyle m}m are variables, and the letter {\displaystyle c}c is a constant, the speed of light in a vacuum. Algebra gives methods for writing formulas and solving equations that are much clearer and easier than the older method of writing everything out in words.

The word algebra is also used in certain specialized ways. A special kind of mathematical object in abstract algebra is called an "algebra", and the word is used, for example, in the phrases linear algebra and algebraic topology.

A mathematician who does research in algebra is called an algebraist.
Some areas of mathematics that fall under the classification abstract algebra have the word algebra in their name; linear algebra is one example. Others do not: group theory, ring theory, and field theory are examples. In this section, we list some areas of mathematics with the word "algebra" in the name.

Elementary algebra, the part of algebra that is usually taught in elementary courses of mathematics.
Abstract algebra, in which algebraic structures such as groups, rings and fields are axiomatically defined and investigated.
Linear algebra, in which the specific properties of linear equations, vector spaces and matrices are studied.
Boolean algebra, a branch of algebra abstracting the computation with the truth values false and true.
Commutative algebra, the study of commutative rings.
Computer algebra, the implementation of algebraic methods as algorithms and computer programs.
Homological algebra, the study of algebraic structures that are fundamental to study topological spaces.
Universal algebra, in which properties common to all algebraic structures are studied.
Algebraic number theory, in which the properties of numbers are studied from an algebraic point of view.
Algebraic geometry, a branch of geometry, in its primitive form specifying curves and surfaces as solutions of polynomial equations.
Algebraic combinatorics, in which algebraic methods are used to study combinatorial questions.
Relational algebra: a set of finitary relations that is closed under certain operators.
Many mathematical structures are called algebras:

Algebra over a field or more generally algebra over a ring.
Many classes of algebras over a field or over a ring have a specific name:
Associative algebra
Non-associative algebra
Lie algebra
Hopf algebra
C*-algebra
Symmetric algebra
Exterior algebra
Tensor algebra
In measure theory,
Sigma-algebra
Algebra over a set
In category theory
F-algebra and F-coalgebra
T-algebra
In logic,
Relation algebra, a residuated Boolean algebra expanded with an involution called converse.
Boolean algebra, a complemented distributive lattice.
