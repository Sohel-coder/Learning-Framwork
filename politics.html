<font face="verdana"size="5"color="black">The politics of India works within the framework of the country's constitution.
India is a federal parliamentary democratic republic in which the President of India is the head of state and 
the Prime Minister of India is the head of government. India follows the dual polity system, 
i.e. a double government (federal in nature) that consists of the central authority at the centre and states at the periphery.
The constitution defines the organisational powers and limitations of both central and state governments, and it is well recognised, rigid and considered supreme;
i.e. the laws of the nation must confirm to it.

There is a provision for a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper house, the Rajya Sabha (Council of States),
which represents the states of the Indian federation, and a lower house, the Lok Sabha (House of the People),
which represents the people of India as a whole. The Indian constitution provides for an independent judiciary,
which is headed by the Supreme Court. The court's mandate is to protect the constitution, to settle disputes between the central government and the states,
to settle inter-state disputes, to nullify any central or state laws that go against the constitution and to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, issuing writs for their enforcement in cases of violation
[1] There are 545 members in the Lok Sabha, out of which 543 are elected from the 543 Indian constituencies and other 2 are from the Anglo-Indian community.
There are 245 members in the Rajya Sabha, out of which 233 are elected by indirect elections by single transferable vote and other 12 members are elected/nominated by the President of India.
Governments are formed through elections held every five years (unless otherwise specified), by parties that secure a majority of members in their respective lower houses (Lok Sabha in the central government and Vidhan Sabha in states).
India had its first general election in 1951, which was won by the Indian National Congress, a political party that went on to dominate subsequent elections until 1977, when a non-Congress government was formed for the first time in independent India.
The 1990s saw the end of single-party domination and the rise of coalition governments. The elections for the 16th Lok Sabha, held from April 2014 to May 2014, once again brought back single-party rule in the country,
with the Bharatiya Janata Party being able to claim a majority in the Lok Sabha.[2]

In recent decades, Indian politics has become a dynastic affair.[3] Possible reasons for this could be the party stability, absence of party organisations,
independent civil society associations that mobilise support for the parties and centralised financing of elections.[4] The Economist Intelligence Unit rated India as a "flawed democracy" in 2016.[5]
Political parties and alliances
For other political parties, see List of political parties in India. An overview on elections and election results is included in Elections in India.
Main articles: 2009 Indian general election and Indian general election, 2014
Comparing with other democratic countries, India has a large number of political parties. It has been estimated that over 200 parties were formed after India became independent in 1947.[6]

Some features of the political parties in India are that the parties are generally woven around their leaders, the leaders are actively playing a dominant role, and that the role of leadership can be transferred, thus tending to take a dynastic route. The two main parties in India are the Bharatiya Janata Party, also known as the BJP and the Indian National Congress, commonly called the INC or simply Congress. These two parties dominate national politics. On the left–right political spectrum, the Indian National Congress is a welfare-heavy, centre party, whereas the BJP (claiming to be fiscally conservative, but also welfare-heavy and government interventionist) is a socially right-wing party.

Types of political parties
Main article: List of political parties in India
There are two types of political parties in India - National Party and Regional/State party. Every political party must have a symbol and must be registered with the Election Commission of India. Symbols are used in the Indian political system to identify political parties and so that illiterate people can also vote by recognizing the party symbols.[7]

In the current amendment to the Symbols Order, the Commission has asserted the following five principles:[8]

A party, National or State, must have a legislative presence.
A National party's legislative presence must be in the Lok Sabha. A State party's legislative presence must be in the State Assembly.
A party can set up a candidate only from amongst its own members.
A party that loses its recognition shall not lose its symbol immediately but shall be allowed to use that symbol for some time to try and retrieve its status. (However, the grant of such facility to the party will not mean the extension of other facilities to it, as are available to recognized parties, such as free time on Doordarshan or AIR, free supply of copies of electoral rolls, etc.)
Recognition should be given to a party only on the basis of its own performance in elections and not because it is a splinter group of some other recognized party.
Criteria

A political party shall be eligible to be recognized as a National party if:[8]
it secures at least six percent (6%) of the valid votes polled in any four or more states, at a general election to the House of the People or, to the State Legislative Assembly; and
in addition, it wins at least four seats in the House of the People from any State or States.
OR
it wins at least two percent (2%) seats in the House of the People (i.e., 11 seats in the existing House having 543 members), and these members are elected from at least three different States.

Likewise, a political party shall be entitled to be recognized as a State party, if:
it secures at least six percent (6%) of the valid votes polled in the State at a general election, either to the House of the People or to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned; and
in addition, it wins at least two seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned.
OR
it wins at least three percent (3%) of the total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State, or at least three seats in the Assembly, whichever is more.

At present there are seven national parties and many more state parties.

Party proliferation
Since 1984 when a strict anti-defection law passed, there has been a tendency amongst the Indian politicians to float their own parties rather than join a broad based party such as the Congress or the BJP. For example, between the 1984 and 1989 elections, the number of parties contesting elections increased from 33 to 113.In the decades since then the trend of fragmentation has continued.[9]

Alliances
India has a history of alliances and breakdown of alliances. However, there are three alliances on a national level in India, competing with each other for the position of Government. The member parties work in harmony for gratifying national interests, although a party can jump ships. The three alliances are–

National Democratic Alliance (NDA) - Centre-Right coalition led by BJP was formed in 1998 after the elections. NDA formed a government, although the government didn't last long as AIADMK withdrew support from it resulting in 1999 general elections, in which NDA won and resumed power. The coalition government went on to complete the full five-years term, becoming the first non-Congress government to do so. In the 2014 General Elections, NDA once again returned to power for the second time, with a historic mandate of 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats. BJP itself won 282 seats, thereby electing Narendra Modi as the head of the government. In a historic win, the NDA stormed to power for the third term in 2019 with a combined strength of 353 seats, with the BJP itself winning an absolute majority with 303 seats
United Progressive Alliance (UPA) - Centre-Left coalition led by Indian National Congress; this alliance was created after the 2004 general elections, with the alliance forming the Government. The alliance even after losing some of its members, was reelected in 2009 General Elections with Manmohan Singh as head of the government. The alliance has been in the opposition since the 2014 elections, with the INC being the principal opposition party, but without the official status of the Leader of Opposition since they failed to win the minimum required seats.
Third front - A coalition of parties which do not belong to any of the above camps due to certain issues. One of the party in the alliance, the CPI(M), prior to 2009 general elections, was a member party of the UPA. The alliance has no official leading party, and smaller parties often enter and leave the alliance according to political convenience. Many of these parties ally at national level but contest against each other at state level. The inherent problem with such a third front is that they are only bound together by the fact that they are not aligned to either of the two 'main' alliances, and not through similar ideological stances. This often means that this alliance is merely an alliance in name and does not really provide a united front which can serve as an alternative to the two historically prominent alliances. Therefore, despite the presence of this so called Third front and seemingly alternative options,Indian politics by and large remains a de facto two party system at the national level.
Candidate selection
Pre-election alliances are common in India with parties deciding to share seats. This is seen mainly on a state by state basis rather than on the national level. Candidate selection starts after seat sharing has been agreed by alliance partners.

Indian political parties have low level of internal party democracy and therefore, in Indian elections, both at the state or national level, party candidates are typically selected by the party elites, more commonly called the party high command. The party elites use a number of criteria for selecting candidates. These include the ability of the candidates to finance their own election, their educational attainment, and the level of organization the candidates have in their respective constituencies.[10] Quite often the last criterion is associated with candidate criminality.[11]

Local governance
Main articles: Panchayati Raj and Local self-government in India
Panchayati Raj Institutions or Local self-government bodies play a crucial role in Indian politics, as it focuses on grassroot-level administration in India.

On April 24, 1993, the Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 came into force to provide constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This Act was extended to Panchayats in the tribal areas of eight States, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan from 24 December 1996.

The Act aims to provide 3-tier system of Panchayati Raj for all States having population of over 2 million, to hold Panchayat elections regularly every 5 years, to provide reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Women, to appoint State Finance Commission to make recommendations as regards the financial powers of the Panchayats and to constitute District Planning Committee to prepare draft development plan for the district.
